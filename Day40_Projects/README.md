## Day 40 Project - Image Compression using k-means algorithm, clustering, pca

### Project Structure 

`spam_classifier.m` - Octave/MATLAB script to set up the dataset for the problem and make calls to user-defined functions.

### How to run?
You can run project either in `octave` or `MATLAB`. 
1. Clone repository using `git clone `
2. `cd` to project directory and either run following command in `octave` or `MATLAB`
2. `run('spam_classifier.m')` to run this project

### Where to find help?
* If you do not have Octave installed, please refer to the installation instructions on the [Octave Download](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) official site.
* At the Octave/MATLAB command line, typing `help` followed by a function name displays documentation for a built-in function. For example, `help plot` will bring up help information for plotting. Further documentation for Octave functions can be found at the [Octave documentation pages](https://octave.org/doc/v5.2.0/). 
* MATLAB is a proprietary software but see if your school/university has a [MATLAB campus license](https://in.mathworks.com/academia/tah-support-program/eligibility.html). 
* MATLAB documentation can be found at the [MATLAB documentation pages](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/?refresh=true).
