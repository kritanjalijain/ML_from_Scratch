## Day 40 Project - K-means algorithm, clustering, PCA

### Project Description
Implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. The K-means algorithm is used for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.

In the second part, principal component analysis is used to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

### How to run?
You can run project either in `octave` or `MATLAB`. 
1. Clone repository using `git clone `
2. `cd` to project directory and either run following command in `octave` or `MATLAB`
2. `run('main_imagecompression.m')` to run this project

### Where to find help?
* If you do not have Octave installed, please refer to the installation instructions on the [Octave Download](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) official site.
* At the Octave/MATLAB command line, typing `help` followed by a function name displays documentation for a built-in function. For example, `help plot` will bring up help information for plotting. Further documentation for Octave functions can be found at the [Octave documentation pages](https://octave.org/doc/v5.2.0/). 
* MATLAB is a proprietary software but see if your school/university has a [MATLAB campus license](https://in.mathworks.com/academia/tah-support-program/eligibility.html). 
* MATLAB documentation can be found at the [MATLAB documentation pages](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/?refresh=true).
