# MATLAB Onramp projects

This repository contains three project part of [MATLAB Onramp course by MathWorks](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/R2018b/portal.html?course=gettingstarted) to get started with MATLAB.

1. Electricity Usage and Prices | [MathWorks Course Link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/R2018b/portal.html?course=gettingstarted#chapter=10&lesson=2&section=1)

This project plot and compare, electricity usage and prices for various economic sectors. 

2. Audio Frequency | [MathWorks Course Link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/R2018b/portal.html?course=gettingstarted#chapter=10&lesson=2&section=1)

This project plot a signal that contains beat phenomenon and then analyze the signal's frequency content.

3. Stellar Motion | [MathWorks Course Link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/R2018b/portal.html?course=gettingstarted#chapter=14&lesson=1&section=1)

This project finds the determine how fast the star is moving away from earth by using the wavelength characteristic spectrum of star.
