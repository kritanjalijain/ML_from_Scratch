# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : August 30, 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge (Hopefully).

**Thoughts** : Today was hectic. One thing led to another and it took me several hours. Hope this will be exciting, will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way.

## Day 1 : August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I started Andrew Ng's course about learning the basics of ML and completed 1/3rd of Week 1.

**Thoughts** : It was really fun. Octave is a good platform to learn ML as a beginner. Today I learnt about surpervised learning and unsupervised learning, linear regression, etc.
I put in extra efforts to google whatever I didn't understand by pausing the video at the moment itself and not keeping it for later.

## Day 2 : September 01, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I have gotten to know about square errored function, cost function, contour plots, computation of gradient descent. 

**Thoughts** : The score have to be improved I will try my best on it and it is really fun .
