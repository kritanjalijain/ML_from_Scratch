# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : August 30, 2020
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge (Hopefully).

**Thoughts** : Today was hectic. One thing led to another and it took me several hours. Hope this will be exciting, will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way.

## Day 1 : August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I started Andrew Ng's course about learning the basics of ML and completed 1/3rd of Week 1.

**Thoughts** : It was really fun. Octave is a good platform to learn ML as a beginner. Today I learnt about surpervised learning and unsupervised learning, linear regression, etc.
I put in extra efforts to google whatever I didn't understand by pausing the video at the moment itself and not keeping it for later.

## Day 2 : September 01, 2020

**Today's Progress** : I have gotten to know about square errored function, cost function, contour plots, computation of gradient descent. 

**Thoughts** : The entire process of analysing both gradient descent and linear regression individually and then applying the gradient descent algorithm to the regression model was really fascinating and fun. Things seem to be really obvious once you understand them truly.
