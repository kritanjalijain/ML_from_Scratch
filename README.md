# ML
This repo contains personal/pet projects made for understanding algorithms from scratch and training models in their entirety **without using machine learning libraries like tensorflow**


### Projects
1. [Handwriting recognition using neural networks backprogapation](https://github.com/kritanjalijain/ML_from_Scratch/tree/master/Backpropagation_Neural_Network) 
1. [Handwriting recognition using one-vs-all classification neural networks](https://github.com/kritanjalijain/ML_from_Scratch/tree/master/Multi-Classification_Neural_Network) 
1. [Spam Email Classfier Using SVM](https://github.com/kritanjalijain/ML_from_Scratch/tree/master/SVM)
